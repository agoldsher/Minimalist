# TheMinimalist
Have you ever thought to yourself: "I only use this once a year and it takes up so much space!"
How about this: "I need a tool for my project but don't want to buy it..."

The answer to your problem is: *TheMinimalist*.

*TheMinimalist* is a peer-to-peer rental service for any and all of those things that you might need just once a year. If you have an item that you want to rent, or would like to lend out to others for some extra money, look no further! The journey to a clutter-free money-making life starts now :)

# App Introduction
We strive to make the experience of the app match our minimalist philosophy: simple, high quality, and enjoyable. Every page emulates this philosophy, so relax and enjoy!

# Hosted on Heroku

## Login
You probably want less, but no one wants stuff stolen, so we take your security seriously. Every use needs to login. Eventually we will enable login through Facebook, Google, GitHub, and others, as well as two factor authentication. This is at the top of our priority list.
